# Chess Game Front

When the game starts, a knight and an destination will randomly appear on the board, where the knight wins when he moves to the destination.

Correspondingly, I need to provide two help buttons, one can prompt the next step, and the other directly helps to move to the destination.

## Debugging in Local

- npm start
